# YouTube_API_ETL
Within my project, I've  orchestrated a YouTube API ETL pipeline using Airflow. This effective process extracts data, transforms it into structured frames, and ensures accuracy via data validation. The subsequent loading into Google BigQuery sets the stage for comprehensive analytics. For analytic process will be use Power BI.
