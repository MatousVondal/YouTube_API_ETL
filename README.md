# YouTube_API_ETL
Within my project, I've  orchestrated a YouTube API ETL pipeline using Airflow. This effective process extracts data, transforms it into structured frames, and ensures accuracy via data validation. The subsequent loading into Google BigQuery sets the stage for comprehensive analytics. For analytic process will be use Power BI.

# Why youtube API?
I chose the YouTube API as the foundation for my project due to its unparalleled ability to grant me access to a vast and dynamic repository of real-time data. With its extensive coverage of video content, channel metrics, comments, and more, the YouTube API empowers my analysis with a diverse range of insights.
